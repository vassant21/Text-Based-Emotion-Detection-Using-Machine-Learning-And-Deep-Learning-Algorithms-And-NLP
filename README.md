# Emotion Classification Model Documentation

## Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of the emotion classification model implemented in Python using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The model is designed to classify the emotions present in textual data into one of five categories: "anger," "joy," "sadness," "fear," and "surprise." The model utilizes a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), along with a deep learning model consisting of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers.
